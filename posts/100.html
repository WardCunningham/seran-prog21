I bought applications, I bought tools, I bought games. This was back when "shareware" was still legitimate, back before the iPhone App Store made five dollars sound like an outrageous amount of money for a game. I did it to support the little guy, to promote the dream of living in the mountains or a coastal town with the only source of income coming from the sale of homemade code. </p><p>Much of the stuff I bought wasn't great. I bought it because it showed promise, because it clearly had some thought and effort behind it. That I knew it was produced by one person working away in his spare hours softened my expectations.</p><p>The thing is, most people don't think that way.</p><p>These days I still gravitate toward toward apps that were developed by individuals or small companies, but I don't cut them any slack for lack of quality. I can't justify buying an indie game because it has potential but isn't actually fun. I won't downgrade my expectations of interface design and usability so I can use a program created by two people instead of a large corporation.</p><p>That whole term "indie" only means something if you go behind the scenes and find out who wrote a piece of software. And while I think it's fascinating to watch the goings-on of small software developers, it's a quirk shared by a small minority of potential customers. The first rule of being indie is that people don't care if you're indie. You don't get any preferential treatment for not having a real office or a QA department. The only thing that matters is the end result.</p><p>(If you liked this, you might enjoy <a href="83.html">Easy to Please</a>.)</p><p class="s"><a href="100.html" id="perm">permalink</a> <i>June 20, 2011</i></p><h1>previously</h1><ul><li><a href=99.html>Constantly Create</a><li><a href=98.html>Impressed by Slow Code</a><li><a href=97.html>Follow the Vibrancy</a><li><a href=96.html>Revisiting "Tricky When You Least Expect It"</a><li><a href=95.html>Caught-Up with 20 Years of UI Criticism</a></ul></div><div id="c2"><h1><a href="archives.html">archives</a></h1><p><b><a href="https://twitter.com/dadgumjames">twitter</a></b> / <b><a href="mailto:james.hague@gmail.com">mail</a></b></p><div class="s"><p>I'm James Hague, a <a href="56.html">recovering programmer</a> who has been designing video games since the 1980s. <a href="195.html">Programming Without Being Obsessed With Programming</a> and <a href="177.html">Organizational Skills Beat Algorithmic Wizardry</a> are good starting points.
