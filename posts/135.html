What I needed was someone to nudge me in the right direction, someone to objectively point out the bad decisions I was making.</p><p>What I needed was a producer.</p><p>When a band is recording an album, the producer isn't there to write songs or play instruments, but to provide focus and give outside perspective. A good producer should say "Guys, you sound great live, but it's not coming through in the recording; can we try getting everyone in here at same time and see how that goes?" or "We've got three songs with similar wandering breakdowns; if you could replace one, which would it be?"</p><p>(Here I should point out that a producer in the music production sense is different than a producer in film or in video games. Same term, different meanings.)</p><p>If you're a lone wolf or part of a small group building something in your basement, there's tremendous value in being able to step back and get into the producer mindset. Maybe you can't be both a producer and developer at the same time, but recognizing that you need to switch hats periodically is key.</p><p>What are the kinds of question you should be asking when in your producer role?</p><p><b>Are you letting personal technology preferences cloud your vision?</b> Haskell is a great language, but what if you're writing a lot of code that you'd get for free with Python? Yes, Android is open to some extent and iOS isn't, but should you be dismissing the entire iPhone / iPad market for that reason?</p><p><b>Are you avoiding doing the right thing because it's hard?</b> If everyone you show your project to has the same confusion about how a feature works, disregarding it because it would take a month of rearchitecting usually isn't a valid response.</p><p><b>Are you simply copying existing ideas without offering anything new?</b> It's so easy to see a finished application and jump into writing your own version. But think about the problem that it was designed to solve instead of copying the same solution. A painting program doesn't have to use the blueprint laid out by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacPaint">MacPaint</a> in 1984 [EDIT: that blueprint appeared earlier in Draw for the Xerox Alto and SuperDraw for the PC]. An IDE doesn't have to follow the <a href="69.html">project tree view on the left</a> schematic.</p><p><b>Are you spending too much time building your own solutions instead of using what's already out there?</b> Should you really be writing another webserver or markdown formatter or JSON decoder?</p><p><b>Do you understand your audience?</b> If you're building an application for graphic artists, are you familiar with how graphic artists work? Are you throwing out features that would be met with horrified stares?</p><p class="s"><a href="135.html" id="perm">permalink</a> <i>April 22, 2012</i></p><h1>previously</h1><ul><li><a href=134.html>Use and Abuse of Garbage Collected Languages</a><li><a href=133.html>100,000 Lines of Assembly Language</a><li><a href=132.html>This is Why You Spent All that Time Learning to Program</a><li><a href=131.html>Turning Your Code Inside Out</a><li><a href=130.html>Solving the Wrong Problem</a></ul></div><div id="c2"><h1><a href="archives.html">archives</a></h1><p><b><a href="https://twitter.com/dadgumjames">twitter</a></b> / <b><a href="mailto:james.hague@gmail.com">mail</a></b></p><div class="s"><p>I'm James Hague, a <a href="56.html">recovering programmer</a> who has been designing video games since the 1980s. <a href="195.html">Programming Without Being Obsessed With Programming</a> and <a href="177.html">Organizational Skills Beat Algorithmic Wizardry</a> are good starting points.
