WORD = 16 bits
LONG = 32 bits</pre><p>Those names were standard for both the Intel x86 and Motorola 68000 families of processors, and it's easy to see where they came from. "Word" isn't synonymous with a 16-bit value; it refers to the fundamental data size that a computer architecture is built to operate upon. On a 16-bit CPU like the 8086, a word is naturally 16-bits.</p><p>Now it's 2010, and it's silly to think of a 16-bit value as a basic enough unit of data to get to the designation "word." "Long" is similarly out of place, as 32-bit microprocessors have been around for over 25 years, and yet the standard memory cell size is still labeled in a way that makes it sound abnormally large.</p><p>The PowerPC folks got this right back in the early 1990s with this nomenclature:</p><pre>BYTE = 8 bits
HALFWORD = 16 bits
WORD = 32 bits</pre><p>That made sense in 1991, and it's still rational today. (64-bit is now common, but the jump isn't nearly as critical as it was the last time memory cell size doubled. The PowerPC name for "64-bits" is "doubleword.")</p><p>Occasionally you need to reevaluate your assumptions and not just cling to something because it's always been that way.</p><p class="s"><a href="63.html" id="perm">permalink</a> <i>March 4, 2010</i></p><h1>previously</h1><ul><li><a href=62.html>Dehumidifiers, Gravy, and Coding</a><li><a href=61.html>Optimizing for Fan Noise</a><li><a href=60.html>What to do About Erlang's Records?</a><li><a href=59.html>Nothing Like a Little Bit of Magic</a><li><a href=58.html>Flickr as a Business Simulator</a></ul></div><div id="c2"><h1><a href="archives.html">archives</a></h1><p><b><a href="https://twitter.com/dadgumjames">twitter</a></b> / <b><a href="mailto:james.hague@gmail.com">mail</a></b></p><div class="s"><p>I'm James Hague, a <a href="56.html">recovering programmer</a> who has been designing video games since the 1980s. <a href="195.html">Programming Without Being Obsessed With Programming</a> and <a href="177.html">Organizational Skills Beat Algorithmic Wizardry</a> are good starting points.
