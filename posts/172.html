What syntax would you use for a string constant? This isn't a trick; it's as simple as that. If you want to print <code>Hello World</code> then how do you specify a basic string like that in your language?</p><p>I'll give you a moment to think about it.</p><p>The obvious solution is to use quotes: <code>"Hello World"</code>. After all, that's how it works in English, so it's easy to explain to new students of your language. But then someone is going to ask "What if I want to put a quotation mark <i>inside</i> a string? That's a legitimate question, because it's easy to imagine displaying a string like:</p><pre>"April 2013" could not be found.</pre><p>There are a couple of options to fix this. Some form of escape character is one, so an embedded quote is preceded by, say, a backslash. That works, but now you've got to explain a second concept in order to explain strings. Another option is to allow both single and double quotes. If your string contains single quotes, enclose it in double quotes, and vice-versa. A hand goes up, and someone asks about how to enter this string:</p><pre>"April 2013" can't be found.</pre><p>Ugh. Now you have two kinds of string delimiters, and you still need escapes. You need to explain these special cases up front, because they're so easy to hit.</p><p>What if instead falling back on the unwritten rule of using single and double quotes, strings were demarcated by something less traditional? Something that's not common in Latin-derived languages? I'll suggest a vertical bar:</p><pre>|"April 2013" can't be found.|</pre><p>That may be uncomfortable at first glance, but give it a moment. Sure, a vertical bar will end up in a string at some point--regular expressions with alternation come to mind--but the exceptional cases are no longer blatant and nagging, and you could get through a beginning class without even mentioning them.</p><p>(If you liked this, you might enjoy <a href="73.html">Explaining Functional Programming to Eight-Year-Olds</a>.)</p><p class="s"><a href="172.html" id="perm">permalink</a> <i>May 11, 2013</i></p><h1>previously</h1><ul><li><a href=171.html>Remembering a Revolution That Never Happened</a><li><a href=170.html>Exploring the Lower Depths of Terseness</a><li><a href=169.html>Expertise, the Death of Fun, and What to Do About It</a><li><a href=168.html>Don't Be Distracted by Superior Technology</a><li><a href=167.html>Simplicity is Wonderful, But Not a Requirement</a></ul></div><div id="c2"><h1><a href="archives.html">archives</a></h1><p><b><a href="https://twitter.com/dadgumjames">twitter</a></b> / <b><a href="mailto:james.hague@gmail.com">mail</a></b></p><div class="s"><p>I'm James Hague, a <a href="56.html">recovering programmer</a> who has been designing video games since the 1980s. <a href="195.html">Programming Without Being Obsessed With Programming</a> and <a href="177.html">Organizational Skills Beat Algorithmic Wizardry</a> are good starting points.
