It's about being able to implement your ideas.</p></div></div><div class="box"><div id="c1"><h1>I Am Not a Corporation</h1><p>In 2009, when I exclusively used a fancy Nikon DSLR, my photographic work flow was this: take pictures during the day, transfer them to a PC in the evening, fiddle with the raw version of each shot in an image editor, save out a full-res copy, make a smaller version and upload it to Flickr.</p><p>Once I started using an iPhone and the Hipstamatic app, my work flow was this: take a picture, immediately upload it to Flickr.</p><p>Pick any criteria for comparing the absolute quality of the Nikon vs the iPhone, and the Nikon wins every time: sharpness, resolution, low-light ability, you name it. It's not even close. And yet I'm willing to trade that for the simplicity and fun of using the iPhone.</p><p>That's because I'm not a professional photographer who gets paid to put up with the inconveniences that come with the higher-end equipment. If I can avoid daily image transfers, that's a win for me. If I don't have to tweak around with contrast settings and color curves, that's huge.</p><p>I also work on projects in my spare time that involve writing code, but I don't have the luxury of a corporate IT department that keeps everything up to date and running smoothly. I don't want to be maintaining my own Linux installation. I would prefer not to wait forty-five minutes to build the latest bug-fix release of some tool. I don't think most developers want to either; that kind of self-justified technical noise feels very 1990s.</p><p>When I'm trying out an idea at home, I'm not getting paid to deal with what a professional software engineer would. If I've got thirty minutes to make progress, I don't want to spend that puzzling out why precompiled headers aren't working. I don't want to spend it debugging a <a href="49.html">makefile quirk</a>. I don't want to decipher an opaque error message because I got something wrong in a C++ template. I don't want to wait for a project to compile <i>at all</i>. I'm willing to make significant trades to avoid these things. If I can get zero or close to zero <a href="45.html">compilation speed</a>, that's worth a 100x performance hit in the resulting code. Seriously.</p><p>If I were a full-time programmer paid to eke out every last bit of performance, then there's no way I'd consider making such a trade. But I'm not, and if I pretended otherwise and insisted on using the same tools and techniques as the full-time pros, I'd end up frustrated and go all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Stoll">Clifford Stoll</a> and move to an internet-free commune in Tennessee.</p><p>Fun and simplicity are only optional if you're paid to ignore them.</p><p>(If you liked this, you might enjoy <a href="123.html">Recovering From a Computer Science Education</a>.)</p><p class="s"><a href="144.html" id="perm">permalink</a> <i>July 3, 2012</i></p><h1>previously</h1><ul><li><a href=143.html>The Silent Majority of Experts</a><li><a href=142.html>Your Coding Philosophies are Irrelevant</a><li><a href=141.html>Another Programming Idiom You've Never Heard Of</a><li><a href=140.html>The Pace of Technology is Slower than You Think</a><li><a href=139.html>We Who Value Simplicity Have Built Incomprehensible Machines</a></ul></div><div id="c2"><h1><a href="archives.html">archives</a></h1><p><b><a href="https://twitter.com/dadgumjames">twitter</a></b> / <b><a href="mailto:james.hague@gmail.com">mail</a></b></p><div class="s"><p>I'm James Hague, a <a href="56.html">recovering programmer</a> who has been designing video games since the 1980s. <a href="195.html">Programming Without Being Obsessed With Programming</a> and <a href="177.html">Organizational Skills Beat Algorithmic Wizardry</a> are good starting points.
