Seeing how much effort it takes to build-up a following. Learning if what you think people will like and what they actually like are the same thing.</p><p>It works just as well for learning what it's like to be in any kind of creative profession, such as an author of fiction or a recording artist.</p><p>Go look at music reviews on Amazon, and you'll see people puzzling over why a band's latest release doesn't have the spark of their earlier material, pointing out filler songs on albums, complaining about inconsistency between tracks. Sometimes the criticisms are empty, but there's often a ring of truth. There's an underlying question of <i>why</i>. How could a songwriter or band release material that isn't always at the pinnacle of perfection?</p><p>After years of posting photos to Flickr, I get it. I'm just going along, taking my odd photographs, when all of a sudden one resonates and breaks through and I watch the view numbers jump way up. Then I've got pressure: How can I follow that up? Sometimes I do, with a couple of winners in a row, but inevitably I can't stay at that level. Sometimes I take a break, not posting shots for a month or more, and then I lose all momentum.</p><p>When I'm at a low point, when I devolve into taking pictures of mundane subjects, pictures I know aren't good, I think about how I'm ever going to get out of that rut. Inevitably I do, though it's often a surprise when I go from a forgettable photo one day to something inspired the next.</p><p>The key for me is to keep going, to keep taking and posting photos. If I get all perfectionist then there's too much pressure, and I start second-guessing myself. If I give up when my quality drops off, then that's not solving anything. The steady progress of continual output, whether good or bad output, is part of the overall creative process.</p><p class="s"><a href="99.html" id="perm">permalink</a> <i>May 22, 2011</i></p><h1>previously</h1><ul><li><a href=98.html>Impressed by Slow Code</a><li><a href=97.html>Follow the Vibrancy</a><li><a href=96.html>Revisiting "Tricky When You Least Expect It"</a><li><a href=95.html>Caught-Up with 20 Years of UI Criticism</a><li><a href=94.html>If You're Not Gonna Use It, Why Are You Building It?</a></ul></div><div id="c2"><h1><a href="archives.html">archives</a></h1><p><b><a href="https://twitter.com/dadgumjames">twitter</a></b> / <b><a href="mailto:james.hague@gmail.com">mail</a></b></p><div class="s"><p>I'm James Hague, a <a href="56.html">recovering programmer</a> who has been designing video games since the 1980s. <a href="195.html">Programming Without Being Obsessed With Programming</a> and <a href="177.html">Organizational Skills Beat Algorithmic Wizardry</a> are good starting points.
